# SDL-Game Coin Collector

## About
This game is based on the 2D Snake game. 

### Objective
The objective of the game is to collect as many coins as possible, while avoiding the path of the wolfs.
Initailly there is only one wolf to worry about, but after collecting 6 coins another wolf is introduced; thereby enhancing the difficulty of the game. Another feature that increases the difficulty is that the speed of the hero increases slightly with evry coin collected.
